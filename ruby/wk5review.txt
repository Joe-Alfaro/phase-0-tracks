Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?

A data structure lets us store other objects together, even other data structures.

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.

An array is a two dimensional list. every part of an array is a numbered index.

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.

A grocery list, and a list of names.

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.

A hash stores information with keys. The keys can be used to call on and edit other information.

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.

Actors and movies they've been in and car makers and their models.

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?

We can go through our lists of stored data and do something to each one.

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.

A hash of player names and scores and the scores have to be updated every round.

Blocks
8. What is a block?

A block of code, it's code that could stand on it own and is a couple of lines.

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?

A block parameter is when a method, array, or hash take a block as an argument.
